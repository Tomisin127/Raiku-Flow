# Raiku-Flow
Zero-MEV, slot-guaranteed multi-DEX settlement, where execution timing is no longer a risk.
# Raiku-Flow: Deterministic Cross-DEX Settlement Engine

**Category:** Finance Applications  
**Team:** Submission – Concept & Design by [Paul Raimi and Njedika Cyril]  
**Type:** Design Blueprint + Figma Prototype + Short Video Explanation


## Overview

Raiku-Flow is a conceptual DeFi protocol that leverages Raiku’s deterministic execution guarantees to enable zero-MEV, multi-DEX settlement on Solana.

It gives developers and institutions full control over transaction timing and order across multiple decentralized exchanges.


## The Problem

On current blockchains, transaction execution is uncertain. MEV bots exploit ordering, creating risk and inefficiency for both users and protocols.

Solana’s speed helps, but without deterministic execution, timing remains probabilistic.


## The Solution

Raiku-Flow introduces *slot-reserved, deterministic trading batches*. By using Raiku’s Ahead-of-Time (AOT) slot reservations, users can predefine:

- Exactly **when** each transaction will execute
- The **sequence** across DEXs
- The **guaranteed atomicity** of their settlement flow

This unlocks a new class of fair, predictable DeFi.


## Key Features

- **Guaranteed Slot Execution:** Every trade executes in a pre-reserved slot.
- **Atomic Multi-DEX Settlements:** Batches across Orca, Raydium, Phoenix, etc.
- **MEV-Free Matching:** Transactions bypass mempool and auction randomness.
- **Predictable Latency:** Institutional-grade timing for HFT and arbitrage.
- **Composable Blueprint:** Ready for Raiku SDK integration.


## How It Works (Concept Flow)

1. User selects DEXs & trading pairs.
2. Chooses a time window (e.g., “Execute at Slot 32,804,200 ±1 slot”).
3. Raiku reserves slots deterministically.
4. Transaction batch executes sequentially across DEXs.
5. Results are finalized with guaranteed order, no front-running.


## Visual Prototype (Figma)

**Screens:**
1. **Home:** “Create Deterministic Trade Batch” button.
2. **DEX Selection:** Choose DEXs + pairs (Raydium, Orca, Phoenix).
3. **Slot Reservation UI:** Raiku Slot Timeline visualization (like a calendar of upcoming slots).
4. **Preview Batch:** Shows order, timestamps, expected outcome.
5. **Confirmation Screen:** “Reserved Slot Executed Successfully”


## Why It Matters

Raiku-Flow showcases how deterministic execution makes institutional-grade precision possible for everyone.

By guaranteeing order and timing, Raiku transforms DeFi from probabilistic to programmable.
